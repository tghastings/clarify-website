================================================================================
SCENE 1: THE TC'S REALITY (0-25 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Workload stats - 32 transactions, 147 deadlines, 8 agents]

"Thirty-two active transactions. One hundred forty-seven deadlines this week. Eight different agents, each with their own way of doing things."

"This is your Tuesday."

"And here's the reality: every spreadsheet, every deadline, every document... lives in a completely different place."

"You're not just coordinating transactions. You're juggling chaos."

================================================================================
SCENE 2: THE SPREADSHEET HELL (25-55 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Chaos grid - spreadsheets, calendars, emails, documents]

"Let's talk about the TC reality that nobody warns you about."

"A different spreadsheet for every agent. Different formats. Different update schedules. Hours spent just keeping them in sync."

"Manual deadline tracking. Copy-pasting dates into calendars. Praying nothing falls through the cracks."

"Status update emails that take HOURS every week. Agents asking 'Where are we on this?' Clients asking 'What's happening?'"

"Documents scattered across email, Dropbox, Google Drive, and that one folder you can never find."

"You spend more time organizing than actually coordinating."

================================================================================
SCENE 3: ENTER CLARIFY.RE (55-85 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Clarify.RE logo with TC-specific benefits]

"What if there was a better way?"

"Introducing Clarify.RE - built specifically for transaction coordinators."

"Imagine ONE dashboard where you see ALL your transactions. Every agent. Every deal. Every deadline. In one place."

"Smart playbooks that apply twenty or more tasks to a new transaction with a single click. Tasks that automatically schedule themselves based on contract dates."

"Dual AI that reviews every contract the moment it's uploaded - catching compliance issues before they become problems."

"And client portals that let buyers and sellers track their own progress - eliminating those constant 'What's happening?' calls."

================================================================================
SCENE 4: MULTI-AGENT DASHBOARD (85-120 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Dashboard preview with agent rows and status]

"Let me show you your new command center."

"At a glance, you see everything: Thirty-two active transactions. Five with deadlines today. Twelve closing this month."

"But here's where it gets powerful. You see each agent's portfolio instantly. Sarah Johnson - eight transactions, all on track. Mike Peters - twelve transactions, two need your attention. Lisa Martinez - six transactions, smooth sailing."

"Click into any transaction and you see every task, every document, every deadline. No more hunting through emails. No more spreadsheet chaos."

"When something needs attention, Clarify.RE tells you. Proactively. Before it becomes a crisis."

================================================================================
SCENE 5: SMART PLAYBOOKS (120-155 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Playbook selection and task list]

"Now let's talk about Smart Playbooks - your secret weapon."

"Select a playbook for the transaction type. Colorado Residential Purchase? Done. Commercial Lease? Done. Short Sale? We've got you covered."

"With one click, twenty-three tasks are created and scheduled automatically."

"Send welcome email to buyer - Day one. Order title commitment - Day three. Schedule inspection - five days before the inspection deadline."

"Notice those date formulas? Tasks calculate their due dates based on actual contract milestones. Inspection date minus five days. Closing date minus seven days."

"No more manual calendar entries. No more missed deadlines. Ever."

"And you can customize these playbooks for each agent's preferences. Build once, use forever."

================================================================================
SCENE 6: SCALE YOUR BUSINESS (155-190 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Stats grid and CTA]

"Here's the bottom line for your TC business."

"Double your transaction capacity. Take on twice as many files without working twice as many hours."

"Spend seventy-five percent less time on administrative tasks. No more spreadsheet updates. No more manual deadline tracking."

"Zero missed deadlines. Automated reminders catch everything before it slips."

"And one hundred percent compliance confidence with dual AI reviewing every contract."

"Clarify.RE isn't just software. It's your path to scaling a TC business that doesn't consume your entire life."

"Ready to take on more transactions without the overwhelm?"

"Request early access to Clarify.RE today."
