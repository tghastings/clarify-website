================================================================================
SCENE 1: THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE (0-25 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Org chart - You at top, 12 agents, 45 transactions, ??? status]

"You've built a team. Twelve agents. Forty-five active transactions. Millions in pipeline value."

"But here's the question that keeps you up at night:"

"What's REALLY happening in your brokerage right now?"

"Most team leaders don't know... until it's too late."

================================================================================
SCENE 2: THE VISIBILITY PROBLEM (25-55 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Problem list with warning icons]

"Let's talk about the leadership blind spots that cost brokerages money."

"No real-time visibility. You find out about problems AFTER they've become crises. That missed deadline? You heard about it from an angry client."

"Compliance risk exposure. One agent's mistake can cost your entire brokerage. Lawsuits. Fines. Reputation damage."

"Inconsistent client experience. Every agent doing things their own way. Some clients get five-star service. Others... not so much."

"Pipeline surprises. Forecasting revenue is basically guesswork. Deals fall through that you didn't even know were at risk."

================================================================================
SCENE 3: ENTER CLARIFY.RE (55-85 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Clarify.RE logo with brokerage benefits]

"What if you could see everything happening across your brokerage... in real time?"

"Introducing Clarify.RE - Command and Control for your brokerage."

"Real-time visibility into every single transaction. Know the status of every deal, every agent, every deadline... instantly."

"Dual AI compliance verification on every contract. Issues are flagged before they become problems - protecting your agents AND your brokerage."

"White-label client portals that elevate YOUR brand. Every client gets a premium experience, no matter which agent they work with."

"And agent performance analytics at a glance. See who's crushing it. See who needs support. Make data-driven decisions."

================================================================================
SCENE 4: BROKERAGE DASHBOARD (85-120 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Dashboard with metrics and chart]

"Let me show you your new command center."

"Four point two million dollars in pipeline value. Forty-five active deals. Three transactions that need your attention today."

"This isn't data you're hunting for in spreadsheets. This is your brokerage... at a glance."

"See monthly closings trending upward. Spot bottlenecks before they impact revenue. Know exactly where your business stands."

"And when something needs attention? Clarify.RE tells you proactively. No more surprises."

================================================================================
SCENE 5: AGENT PERFORMANCE & COMPLIANCE (120-155 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Leaderboard and compliance score]

"Now let's talk about your most valuable asset: your agents."

"See your top performers instantly. Sarah's leading with one point two million in pipeline. Mike's close behind at nine-eighty."

"But it's not just about volume. It's about quality."

"Your team's compliance score: ninety-eight percent. Every contract AI-verified. Zero compliance issues across the brokerage."

"And every week, Clarify.RE generates a summary report delivered straight to your inbox. Wins, risks, opportunities - all in one place."

"This is how modern brokerages operate."
