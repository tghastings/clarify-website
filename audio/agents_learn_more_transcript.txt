================================================================================
SCENE 1: THE AGENT'S REALITY (0-20 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Chaos grid showing emails, deadlines, documents, and active deals]

"One hundred forty-seven unread emails. Three deadlines hitting today. Twenty-three documents waiting for your review. Eight active deals demanding your attention."

"Sound familiar?"

"If you're like most agents, you're spending over sixty percent of your time on administrative work... instead of what you do best: building relationships and closing deals."

================================================================================
SCENE 2: THE OLD WAY PAIN POINTS (20-40 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Pain points list with X icons]

"The traditional way of managing transactions is broken."

"Manual contract review means hours of reading every page, hoping you don't miss a compliance issue that could cost you the deal... or worse, your license."

"Tracking deadlines across spreadsheets, sticky notes, and calendar apps. It's chaos."

"And your clients? They're anxious. Calling you every day asking 'What's happening with my deal?' - time you could be spending on your next listing."

"One missed item can kill a deal or cost you thousands in liability."

================================================================================
SCENE 3: ENTER CLARIFY.RE - THE SOLUTION (40-60 seconds)
================================================================================

"There's a better way."

"Introducing Clarify.RE - real estate transactions, simplified by AI."

"Imagine if AI could review your contracts in seconds, not hours."

"Imagine automated deadline tracking that never lets a critical date slip."

"Imagine your clients tracking their own deal progress - eliminating those daily status calls."

"And imagine two AI systems working together, catching compliance issues that even experienced agents miss."

"That's exactly what Clarify.RE delivers."

================================================================================
SCENE 4: DUAL AI CONTRACT MAGIC (60-80 seconds)
================================================================================

"Here's where it gets interesting."

"When you upload a contract to Clarify.RE, something unique happens. Two independent AI systems - Claude and ChatGPT - analyze every clause, every date, every detail simultaneously."

"They extract property information, buyer and seller details, key dates, and contingencies automatically."

"But here's the breakthrough: we only flag issues when BOTH AI systems agree there's a problem."

"That means dramatically higher accuracy and fewer false positives wasting your time."

"Financing deadline unclear in Section 8? Both AIs spotted it. You'll know before it becomes a crisis."

================================================================================
SCENE 5: CLIENT PORTAL MAGIC (80-100 seconds)
================================================================================

[Visual: Client portal preview with progress tracking]

"Now let's talk about your clients."

"With Clarify.RE, every client gets their own branded portal. Your branding. Your name. Your professional image."

"They can log in anytime to see exactly where their deal stands. What milestones are complete. What's coming next. How many days until closing."

"They can view and sign documents, track deadlines, and message you directly."

"The result? No more 'What's happening with my deal?' phone calls."

"Your clients feel informed and confident. You look like a superstar agent who has everything under control."

================================================================================
SCENE 6: RESULTS & CTA (100-120 seconds)
